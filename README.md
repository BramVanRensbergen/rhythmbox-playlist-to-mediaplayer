Rhythmbox-Playlists-Export
==========================

Use DBus to export smart and dumb playlists to standard playlist files (M3U).

Also use to sync rhythmbox and associated media to another machine.
Also use to sync the exported playlists to another machine.
Both of these activities involve modifying the paths of files so they point to the correct new location on the other machine.

I'm using this to sync rhythmbox between my wife's laptop and our server and to export her playlists to M3U so we can play them in XBMC and via our Squeezebox Radio.
